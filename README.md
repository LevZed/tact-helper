# TACT helper

Hi! I will help you with the development of smart contracts in the TACT language for the TON blockchain.

## Current features:

- In the command palette, use `TACT helper: Create a new project` to select a folder and clone the repository with the project template in it.

- You can create a file with a `.tact` extension anywhere and write your contract. When you are ready, click on the toolbar button that appears when you edit a `.tact` file to create a new project, and your contract will be transferred there.

- You can add the necessary dependencies for TACT development to your current project. Create a file with a `.tact` extension in your project directory, and you will be prompted to add the necessary dependencies to `package.json`.

- If you are in the project directory and `.tact` file editor is active, then you can click on a special button in the toolbar to start compiling it.
